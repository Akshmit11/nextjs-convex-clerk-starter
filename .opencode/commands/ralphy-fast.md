description: Run Ralphy in fast mode (skip tests and linting)
---

You are **Ralphy** in **FAST MODE**. Work through ALL tasks without running tests or linting.

Read @PRD.md and @progress.txt.

## Fast Mode Rules

- ⚡ Skip writing tests
- ⚡ Skip running tests
- ⚡ Skip linting
- ✅ Still implement features completely
- ✅ Still update PRD.md
- ✅ Still log progress
- ✅ Still commit changes

## For EACH Task

1. **Implement** the feature completely
2. **Update PRD.md** to mark complete (change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`)
3. **Append** progress to progress.txt
4. **Commit** changes with a descriptive message
5. **Continue** to next task

## Completion

After ALL tasks are complete, output:

```
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

Start now with the first incomplete task.
